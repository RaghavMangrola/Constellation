# Project Improvement Tasks

This document lists actionable tasks to improve the codebase, focusing on guardrails, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and senior engineering best practices. Each task will be tracked and referenced in its own branch and PR.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization
- [ ] Review and refactor directory/file structure for clarity and modularity.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary or duplicate files (e.g., stray `.DS_Store`).

## 2. Documentation & Onboarding
- [ ] Audit and update `README.md` and `SETUP.md` for accuracy and completeness.
- [ ] Review and update documentation in `docs/` for relevance and clarity.

## 3. Code Quality & Simplicity (KISS)
- [ ] Identify and refactor overly complex functions or classes.
- [ ] Simplify logic and break down large files where possible.
- [ ] Enforce consistent naming conventions and code style.

## 4. Guardrails & Error Handling
- [ ] Audit error handling in audio processing, file I/O, and rendering/shader code.
- [ ] Add assertions, preconditions, and safe unwrapping of optionals where needed.

## 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Check for presence of unit/integration tests; add where missing.
- [ ] Ensure edge cases and invalid inputs are handled and tested.

## 6. Configuration & Constants
- [ ] Centralize configuration values and constants; remove hardcoded values from codebase.

## 7. Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] Identify and address performance bottlenecks (e.g., rendering, audio loops).
- [ ] Ensure proper resource cleanup (e.g., audio buffers, Metal resources).

## 8. Build & Dependency Management
- [ ] Review Xcode project settings for build warnings/errors and unused targets.
- [ ] Audit and document external dependencies (if any).

## 9. Security & Privacy
- [ ] Audit handling of user data, permissions, and sensitive information.
- [ ] Ensure no secrets or credentials are committed to the repository.

## 10. UX & Accessibility
- [ ] Review UI for accessibility and user experience best practices.
